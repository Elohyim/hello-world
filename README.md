First Try 
The Lord is my Shepherd I shall npt want 
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures 
He leadeth me beside the still waters 
He restoreth my soul 
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness for His Name sake
Yea tho I walk through the valley of the shadow of death 
I fear no evil for Thou art with me 
Thy Rod and Thy staff they comfort me.
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.
thou annointest my head with oil 
my cup runneth over sure goodness and mercies shall follow me all the days of mine life 
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever and ever Amen.
